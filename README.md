## Contributing

If you'd like to add a util, please make an issue first and then create a pull
request when it is assigned to you.

If it is not functional, and it has not been touched for 90 days, the pull
request will be marked as `stale` and the issue will be unassigned, and open
for the taking.

If you do _not_ want to be assigned, please specify that in the issue
description.
